In theory, it should compile out of the box, if you have
the required headers & libs from fidoconfig & smapilns installed.
As I am a nice guy, configure checks this out, und refuses to compile,
until you installed them.
(This cvs checkout lacks the ceck, but if hpt compiles, you should have everything within reach)
