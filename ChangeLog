-----------------------------------------------------------
99.01.16:
+	Highlight of Msgs from/to me is done.
	(But needs to be configured)
-	The new classes seen to work, now they want to be documented

99.01.15:
-	After a time of redesign, I put up again with the changelog
	I won't put all changes in here, as there are to many changes,
        and the classes are not yet documented, so, who cares?
*	Right now, the new classe work, next big step is the compose window,
	but I feel a litte overdone. I startet 'bout 11 in the morning, now it's
        21:25. So, I will get a good bottle of wine now, and make my mind free by reading
        some mail. (Maybe last day using Golded?)
        Well, after that, slashdot will be a good starting point, and after that, I will
        take a couple of hours sleep.
        BTW, todays thank-you to Aldi-Kaffe, Holsten Pils, The Verve, Onkelz, The King.
        Think I must start tonite with Falco, just for the memory.

99.01.09:
!	Finished the rewrite of some brain busted conceps.
*	Todays thank-you's go to Melitta, Warsteiner & NOFX

98.12.27:
+	I startet this changelog, after I released an early
       	try version to the cvs 98.12.25. Merry Xmas.
